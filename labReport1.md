# Installing VSCode

First, I navigated to the vscode download webpage and downloaded the appropiate vscode application. The website link can be found here: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After waiting for it to download, I opened up the application and screenshotted the home screen, which looked like this:

# Remotely Connecting

In order to remotely connect, you must SSH into a remote server. SSH has its own security protocol,
so you have to find/reset your login here: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
After logging in with the ssh command and your username/password, you will be greeted with a screen that looks like this:

# Trying Some Commands

After connecting, you should try out some commands and see what they do (examples below).
For example, the command ls -a will list all files in the current directory (even hidden ones)
In order to log out, you can either run the command Ctrl-D or exit.
